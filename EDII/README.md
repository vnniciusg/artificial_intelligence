# Handwritten Text Identification

## Overview
This project aims to develop a system for identifying handwritten text, specifically numbers from 0 to 9. The system will take an input image containing handwritten text and output the corresponding digit.


## Dataset
The system was trained on a dataset of handwritten digits. The dataset consists of images of digits from 0 to 9, with corresponding labels.

## Model Architecture
The system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for digit recognition. The CNN consists of 45 neurons in the input layer, 10 neurons in the hidden layer, and 10 neurons in the output layer. The CNN is trained on the handwritten digit dataset to learn the patterns and features of the digits.
